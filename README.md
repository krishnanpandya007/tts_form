# 🗣️ TTS Form – Voice & Language Enabled Forms

**TTS Form** is an accessibility-first form application built to empower users in rural or under-educated regions who face barriers like typing or reading in local languages.  
It enables people to **speak their responses** and also **visually understand form fields** through **local language translations**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ **Speech-Based Input:** Users can fill out forms by recording their voice, which is transcribed and auto-filled into input fields.  
- ✅ **Local Language Support:** For users who cannot **read field labels**, buttons allow them to **translate labels (e.g., to Gujarati)**, making it easier to understand what’s being asked.  

This dual-approach ensures inclusivity for both **non-typists** and **non-readers**, promoting truly accessible digital interaction.
