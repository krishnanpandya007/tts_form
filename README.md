# 🗣️ TTS Form – Voice-Enabled Form Submission

A voice-to-text powered form system designed to make digital form filling accessible to people in rural or less-educated regions — especially where typing in local languages like **Gujarati** is a challenge.  

Users can speak into the system, and the backend automatically recognizes and transcribes the speech into **Gujarati**, populating the form accordingly.
